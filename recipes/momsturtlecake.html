    <h2 style="text-align:center;">A Twist on Turtle Cake</h2>
    <p>Turtle cake has no specific known origin, however the idea was seemingly inspired by the candy Turtles. Turtles were developed in 1918 by Johnson's Candy Company (which became Demet's Candy Company in 1923) after a salesman came in and showed one of the dippers a piece of candy then the dipper pointed out that the candy looked like a turtle. After this the Johnson's Candy Company started making the same piece of candy but selling it under the name "Turtles"</p>
    <p>This sinful recipe will knock your socks off with a classic Devils Food Cake recipe along with a delicious Caramel Recipe to use as a filling and topping for the cake. The other topping to make this chocolate caramel cake a turtle cake is the chopped pecans. Although an expensive ingredient it really pulls the entire cake together. This recipe is a classic for any party event and will definetly cure any sweet tooth.</p>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees(F) then line(parchment paper) and spray(non-stickbaking spray) one 9-inch round or an 8-inch square pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or and electric hand mixer beat butter until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add in both sugars, one at a time, and beat until the sugar has been incorporated into the butter. Increase the speed and beat on high until the mixture is fluffy and light. This process should take about 4 minutes. Scrape down sides to incorporate everything.</li>
        <li>Add in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Then add in vanilla extract and beat until combined.</li>
