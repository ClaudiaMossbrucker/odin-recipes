    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Extra Moist and Soft Chocolate Chip Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>Banana Bread, although a beloved treat today, was thought to have been a byproduct of the Great Depression. When baking powder became available in grocery stores in the 1930s, many believed the resourceful housewives were looking for ways to use overripe bananas.</p>
    <p>This recipe keeps things simple while using a few special ingredients. The two special ingredients are vanilla yogurt and melted butter. Both are attributing factors in keeping your bread moist. This is my favorite recipe to make and share, and I have only gotten rave reviews from my boyfriend. He would eat the whole loaf if I'm not looking.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ripe Bananas</li>
        <li>2 large Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vanilla yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups of All-purpose flour</html>
        <li>1 tsp Baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup mini Chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Dash of Cinnamon and Cardamom if you're feeling spicy</li>
        <li>Chopped Walnuts for topping if you'd like</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Directions</h3>

        <li>In a seperate bowl, mix together the melted butter and sugars until you reach a paste like consistancy. It's best to use an electric mixer with the paddle attachment.</li>
        <li>Add in mashed bananas followed by by eggs, yogurt, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Once all wet ingredients are mixed together fold in the dry ingredients. Then fold in chocolate chips.

        <li>Bake for 1 to 1 hour 15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before removing from the pan. Don't bring any attention to yourself.</li>
