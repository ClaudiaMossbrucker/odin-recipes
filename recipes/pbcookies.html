    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Soft and Chewy Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <p>Peanut butter cookies date back to the early 1910's; invented by George Washington Carver. The concept was first introduced when Carver published and released a peanut cookbook titled <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/ipd/carver/items/show/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"How to Grow the Peanut: And 105 Ways of Preparing It for Human Consumption"</a>. This was meant to promote peanut growth, Carver found many promising benefits from the versitility that peanuts offer.</p>
    <p>This recipe calls for a little patience. It's best to chill the dough for 20 minutes before scooping. When scooping the dough use cookie scoops and do not roll into smooth balls, rolling can change the consistency and texture of the cookie. I personally like a little flaky salt to add a little pizzaz. This recipe is a classic for anyone not allergic to peanut butter. This recipe has a deep place in my heart, and I know my man will love them everytime.</p>
